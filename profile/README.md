# Mo Chreach Music Technology

Welcome to the GitHub organisation for Mo Chreach Music Technology!
We, and I use the term "we" liberally as it's just me for now,
make music technology software, which is all open source and freely available.
Take a look at our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mochreach)
for tutorials, guides, explainations, on music and programming.
Send us an email if you have any [enquiries](mailto:hello@mochreach.dev).
